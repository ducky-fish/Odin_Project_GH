Completed:
    + connect machineSelect[1] to a variable name
      clean up variable names
        (did as a reassignment to another variable
         after instantiating)
    
    + Pass set state more cleanly; perhaps as function
        (No clue what I meant by this)

Next Features:
    - Make counter of games won and lost
    - see if you can directly assign useState declaration to 
      another variable
